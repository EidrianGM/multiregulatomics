## Questions

### Objective
Represent a pathway status with different omics in which the minimun data to be represented y the logFC and pValue

logFC/quantity = color coded
pValue = size of figure

A pathway contains:
genes
metabolites
interactions

### Issues: Is worthy a 3d viz?

i.e. Can't this 2D overlapping circles work equally and is easier?
